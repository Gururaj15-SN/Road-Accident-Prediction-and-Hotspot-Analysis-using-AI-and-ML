## 🚦 Road Accident Severity Prediction & Hotspot Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **road accident severity** and identifies **high-risk accident hotspots** using historical accident data. By applying **machine learning models** and **clustering techniques**, the system supports **data-driven traffic safety planning and decision-making**.

---

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Geospatial Visualization (Maps)  
- Machine Learning & Clustering Algorithms  

---

### 📊 Key Objectives
- Predict accident severity levels based on historical patterns
- Identify accident-prone locations (hotspots)
- Analyze relationships between road, weather, and traffic conditions
- Support preventive measures and traffic safety strategies

---

### 📈 Key Insights
- Certain locations show consistently **high accident density**
- Accident severity increases under specific **road and environmental conditions**
- Clustering reveals clear **high-risk zones** requiring attention
- Severity prediction models help prioritize safety interventions

---

### 🗺 Visualizations
- Accident severity distribution charts  
- Hotspot identification using clustering  
- Interactive maps highlighting high-risk regions  
- Trend analysis by time, location, and conditions  

---

### 💡 Business / Social Impact
- Enables **traffic authorities** to identify critical accident zones
- Supports **preventive safety measures** and infrastructure planning
- Helps reduce accident severity through early risk identification
- Assists policymakers with **data-backed road safety decisions**
